If you want a distribution that is not available here, you can [build your own](INSTALL_DETAILED.md).
Feel free to contact me if you want me to add your freshly-baked distribution (please provide the .img, or an appropriate compensation for my work if you want me to build it for you).

Note that performances will be awful.
